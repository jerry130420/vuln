Vulnerability Detection Tool
CREATED BY: Dharick
Welcome to the vulnerability scanner

Project Title: Vulnerability Detection Tool

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to develop a command-line vulnerability detection tool in Python that allows users to perform various network scans and information gathering tasks. The tool will rely on external utilities like Nmap, Nikto, SQLMAP, and others to execute these tasks. It will provide a menu-driven interface, validate user input, and offer options for scanning and probing remote hosts and networks.
